# freedom-book
EPUB version of Freedom! by Adam Kokesh

# Compiling the book
This was a very rushed job, there is a simply shell script that uses pandoc to generate the book from mardown source.

On a Mac:
```
$ brew install pandoc
$ cd /path/to/repo
$ ./build.sh

# Releases
See [releases](https://github.com/waynemoore/freedom-book/releases/latest) for a generated EPUB copy of the book
